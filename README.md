# Deep-Learning-Project-For-Breast-Cancer

Image Analysis for the Recognition of Breast Cancer through Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Abstract
Breast Cancer is one of the most common cancers among women that affects about 10% of women worldwide. 
Although there are available treatments for breast cancer, the real challenge is to be properly detected it in early stages, a challenge that doctors and patients encounter 
constantly. In this study, I examine the performance of different deep learning models and depth-wise convolutional neural networks in medical imaging
and assess their performance on breast cancer detection from ultrasounds and breast histopathology images. 
Experimental results suggest that the proposed deep learning models can effectively recognize breast cancer from ultrasound and histopathology images. 
The performance of the Convolutional Neural Network models reached 96.82% accuracy on ultrasounds, 88.23% on breast histology with cases of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)
and 91.04% on cancer-free tissue. The results are very promising and point out that deep-learning methods and 
depth-wise convolutional neural networks are very assistive in the diagnosis of breast cancer from ultrasound and histopathology images.
